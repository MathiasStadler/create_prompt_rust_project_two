   - Converts the input to uppercase
   - Displays the result

### Technical Requirements

1. Project Structure:
   - Create a new project in the current folder
   - Proper Rust project layout with Cargo
   - Separate library and binary crates
   - Organized test directory

2. Dependencies:
   - Use `clap` for CLI argument parsing
   - Implement error handling with `anyhow` and `thiserror`# create prompt rust project

## Project Requirements

- Condition
  - Make all steps for create a new  project init inside a single bash script with all the steps required to create the project

  - Check the output of all commands, scripts, extensions and add-ons. Correct all errors until no more errors occur.
  - To do this, start all test cases until all errors have been corrected.
  - Log the output for each run in a log file in which the commands are also saved
  - Create all components of the project with the commands cargo, cargo init, cargo add and avoid simple text blocks
